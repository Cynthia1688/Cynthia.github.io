### Drawing and Photographing

Aegithalos glaucogularis is my favorite bird. I did a lot of research on it and hope someday I could have one as my friend.

### Reading and Writing

My favorite books: 

1. You Are the April of This World - By Huiyin Lin

   Love story of writer Huiyin Lin and architect Sicheng Liang. 

2. Ever Promised - By Hua Tong

   Romantic stories of traditional Chinese gods.

3. Lin Ching Selected Essays - By Qingxuan Lin

   Essays and thoughts inspired by daily views and things.

4. Beidai Riverside's Fantasy - By Zhimo Xu

   It's a travel essay. The writer did not pay attention to the precise description of the scenery, but instead focused on the expression of his inner feelings by moving away from the scenery in front of him. The whole article has magnificent and colorful words, light and elegant words, and complex and changeable sentences. Through unique imagination and rich emotions, it expresses encouragement to young people. More importantly, it points out that young people cannot "emotionally change" just for the sake of temporary failure. "If the flash is not there", otherwise you can only fall into the darkness of emptiness and be unable to extricate yourself.
   
## _Craziest Things I've DONE_

* Driving car without licenses at 110km/h speed and fortunately survived.
